# Encode

Obtain encoding information in this source code.  
Currently, it is designed to work by itself, but I plan to change it to a function that can be called in the future.  

## How to Use
Give this program the file for which you want to get the encoding information as an argument.  
The command is as follows  
```$ encoding.py File File ...```  
Currently, error handling and help functions are not implemented.
